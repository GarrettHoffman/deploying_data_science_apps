# Deploying Data Science Apps
Slides and Code Samples for Talk on Deploying Data Science Applications

## Notes

**IMPORTANT** - This repo contains all of the application code used for the tutorial but instructions on seting up infrastructure and running the code are still a work in progress. I will be converting this into more of a tutorial by the end of the summer. Follow me on Twitter at [@GarrettLeeH](https://twitter.com/GarrettLeeH) to stay updated.
